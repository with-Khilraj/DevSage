# Requirements Document

## Introduction

DevSage is an intelligent developer assistant that automates routine Git workflow tasks and enhances code quality through AI-powered analysis. The system integrates with popular Git platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to automatically generate commit messages, pull request titles and descriptions, changelogs, and provide real-time code improvement suggestions. DevSage features a React-based dashboard that provides developers and teams with insights into coding patterns, quality metrics, and collaborative workflows, supporting multiple input methods including text, images, and voice commands.

4. IF rate limits are encountered THEN DevSage SHALL handle them gracefully and inform the user
5. WHEN switching between platforms THEN DevSage SHALL maintain separate configurations for each
6. WHEN using a local Git server THEN DevSage SHALL analyze local repos and prepare PRs/commits for later syncing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want DevSage to analyze team coding patterns and provide insights, so that I can identify areas for improvement and help my team develop better coding practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN team members use DevSage THEN the system SHALL collect anonymized coding pattern data
2. WHEN analyzing team patterns THEN DevSage SHALL identify common issues, missing practices, and improvement opportunities
3. WHEN generating team insights THEN DevSage SHALL provide actionable recommendations with specific examples
4. IF test coverage is low THEN DevSage SHALL suggest areas where tests should be added
5. WHEN code review patterns are analyzed THEN DevSage SHALL recommend process improvements
6. WHEN displaying team metrics THEN DevSage SHALL protect individual developer privacy

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interact with DevSage using text, images, or voice commands, so that I can communicate my intentions in the most convenient way for my current situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types instructions THEN DevSage SHALL process natural language commands and respond appropriately
2. WHEN a user uploads an image (sketch, mockup, diagram) THEN DevSage SHALL analyze it and generate relevant code descriptions or PR content

4. IF the input is ambiguous THEN DevSage SHALL ask clarifying questions before proceeding
5. WHEN processing multimodal input THEN DevSage SHALL combine information from different sources for better understanding
6. WHEN a user uploads a login page sketch THEN DevSage SHALL generate a PR description describing the login feature

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want DevSage to work offline for local analysis, so that I can continue working and receive code suggestions even when I don't have internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN internet connectivity is unavailable THEN DevSage SHALL continue analyzing local code changes
